# splitnjoiny
Simple, fast module for splitting text/binary files into multiple chunks and viceversa (from chunks to original file).

"splitnjoiny" is a more refined, performance-driven version of the old [splitnjoin](https://github.com/SergioLaRosa/splitnjoin) module. 

SNN01 team goal is to improve splitting/joining phases to achieve the best possibile reading/writing speeds on many different hardware/software configurations and to optimize resources use on every condition.

Important: **don't use splitnjoiny in production enviroments**. It's not ready yet... but we'll work hard to make it a great production tool (one day).
